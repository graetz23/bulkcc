## BULKCC is a C++ bulk stack implementation ##

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graetz23/bulkcc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graetz23/bulkcc) on travis-ci.com

BULKCC is an object-oriented C++ template based list for storing any data /
object types in one single list. It is ideal directly after some parsing method,
while the parser generates data / objects of known type but in unknown sequence.
Therefore, the data / objects can be pushed in their sequence to a single BULKCC
list, that allows for searching by data / types or reading the sequence again.

The implementation separates the template based methods from tha data / object
list. The data / object list consists of a native base class where a template
class forms the sub class for. However, a controller class implements the auto-
matic template functionality for storing data / objects to the sub class and
queueing up the base class by an infinite pointered list. Have fun. ~8>
